Test #01: large over small
    Dividend:   7 = 0111
    Divisor:    3 = 0011
    Quotient:   2 = 0010
    Remainder:  1 = 0001

Test #02: small over large
    Dividend:   3 = 0011
    Divisor:    7 = 0111
    Quotient:   0 = 0000
    Remainder:  3 = 0011

Test #03: zero over zero
    Dividend:   0 = 0000
    Divisor:    0 = 0000
    Quotient:   inf = 1111
    Remainder:  0 = 0000

Test #04: zero over number
    Dividend:   0 = 0000
    Divisor:    4 = 0100
    Quotient:   0 = 0000
    Remainder:  0 = 0000

Test #05: number over zero
    Dividend:   4 = 0100
    Divisor:    0 = 0000
    Quotient:   inf = 1111
    Remainder:  4 = 0100

Other test cases:
- Changing Go signal during calculation         --> should not interrupt FSM
- Changing Dividend signal during calculation   --> should not interrupt FSM
- Changing Divisor signal during calculation    --> should not interrupt FSM
- Setting Go high after calculation             --> redo division
